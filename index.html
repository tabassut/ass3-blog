            <strong>Challenges encountered:</strong> <br>
            When tackling this assignment, I encountered a few key challenges. One of the biggest hurdles was managing the dynamic creation and filtering of DOM elements. Working with JavaScript's querySelector and createElement methods was tricky, especially ensuring that each element carried the correct data attributes for filtering later on.

 <br>

Another challenge was maintaining a clean and responsive UI. Managing the modal's visibility and resetting form inputs every time the modal closed required careful handling to prevent leftover data from previous entries. Debugging JavaScript can sometimes feel like chasing ghosts, and there were several instances where a small typo caused unexpected behavior. Finally, balancing the organization of the code for readability and ensuring every function had a clear responsibility took some planning.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What I learned:</strong> <br>
            Through this assignment, I deepened my understanding of JavaScript's DOM manipulation capabilities, particularly with createElement, appendChild, and setting dataset attributes. Learning how to add dynamic elements and manipulate classes to show and hide components expanded my understanding of UI development with plain JavaScript.
<br>
I also learned more about debugging techniques, especially how to efficiently use console.log to track variables and check function calls. Another major takeaway was the importance of planning and pseudocode. Laying out the logic beforehand made the coding phase smoother and reduced the need for backtracking.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Resources I found helpful:</strong> <br>
            A few resources proved invaluable throughout this assignment. The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) was my primary reference, especially for JavaScript documentation on functions like querySelector, createElement, and appendChild, which were essential for DOM manipulation. W3Schools also provided quick, example-based explanations that were helpful for double-checking specific concepts, like event listeners and handling form input. Stack Overflow offered practical solutions and insights from other developers’ experiences, particularly when I encountered unexpected bugs or needed guidance on structuring dynamic DOM updates. Each of these resources made learning smoother and kept me on track.
        </p>

            <strong>Had to Google to complete the assignment:</strong> <br>
            To complete the project, I found myself Googling several specific topics that arose as I coded. JavaScript event handling was one such area, as I wanted to ensure I was correctly adding event listeners and managing modal toggling. Best practices for adding and removing elements dynamically, along with input validation techniques, also required quick searches to ensure I was implementing these functions effectively. When I encountered unexpected errors, Google was essential for finding common debugging methods and workarounds. These searches not only clarified my approach to the assignment but also reinforced foundational JavaScript skills I’ll be using again in future projects.
